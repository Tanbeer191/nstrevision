You are worried that your samples might be contaminated with substantial amounts of protein. You use a Bradford assay to test whether this is true. You first make a standard curve using a dilution series of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer. For each BSA sample, you mix 10 µL of the sample with 990 µL of Bradford reagent and measure the absorbance at 595 nm. The results are given in Table 2.",

Plot a standard curve with the BSA values given in Table 2 using the graph paper and calculate the protein concentration of this sample, expressed in mg/mL. Show your workings.",
